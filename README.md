# Early Stopping Implementation for Crop Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation of **early stopping** to prevent overfitting during model training. The model predicts crop prices using agricultural market data, enabling informed decisions for farmers and stakeholders.

## Features
- **Early Stopping**: Automatically stops training when the validation loss stops improving, ensuring optimal performance without overfitting.
- **Neural Network Model**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras for regression tasks.
- **Agricultural Dataset**: Predicts modal prices of crops based on state, district, market, and other features.
- **Scalable Preprocessing**: Includes feature encoding, scaling, and train-test split functionality.

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes agricultural market data with the following columns:
- `state`: The state where the data is collected.
- `district`: The district within the state.
- `market`: The local market name.
- `commodity`: The type of crop.
- `variety`: The specific variety of the commodity.
- `arrival_date`: The date of arrival at the market.
- `min_price`, `max_price`, `modal_price`: Pricing details of the commodity.

**Sample Row:**
```csv
"Odisha","Mayurbhanja","Saraskana","Bhindi(Ladies Finger)","Bhindi","04/03/2019","6000","7000","6500"

Results
Training and Validation Loss

The early stopping mechanism ensures that training halts when validation loss stops improving, avoiding overfitting.

Model Evaluation
Validation Loss: Achieved low validation loss, indicating good generalization.
Validation MAE: Demonstrates minimal prediction error on unseen data.
Future Scope
Extend the model to predict yield or other agricultural metrics.
Integrate the model into a real-time dashboard for farmers.
Add support for additional machine learning algorithms.
